CssPrefixer2

A tool that rewrites your CSS files, adding vendor-prefixed versions of CSS3 rules. This version handles more modern features such as flexbox layout and media requests.

This tool requires no other libraries.

This is an update to [cssprefixer](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cssprefixer), which is missing support for some of the features I need.
